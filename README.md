# LearnLoop
LearnLoop is a collaborative learning platform designed to foster continuous growth through shared knowledge, interactive content, and adaptive learning paths. This project aims to empower learners and educators alike by creating a dynamic environment where learning never stops.

# How does LearnLoop work?
LearnLoop is based on the idea of ​​learning in short, progressive cycles—that is, you learn a concept, apply it immediately, receive feedback, and then learn again based on what worked and what didn't. This cycle repeats, creating a spiral of constant evolution.
